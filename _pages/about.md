My interests rely on mathematical methods for neutron transport problems and fluid dynamics for nuclear reactors. I have particular interests on Branching processes theory, Markov chain techniques and Lattice Boltzmann methods for conservation equations. 

I was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and graduated in Engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. In my master's degree, I studied applied mathematics at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology under the Banach scholarship program.
